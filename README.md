# clean_streets_la

This is a group project in which we want to determine if there is a correlation between clean streets using the Los Angeles Clean Streets Index and other city features, such as household median income and crime locations.

From our findings, if we find a correlation between these features, then we can create a business use case in which we recommend certain street areas with high scores from the Clean Streets Index where business owners could build their businesses. This way, we could incorporate household median income as a proxy for communities with more disposable income that people could spend at these new businesses.

The rate of burglary and break-ins that occur in a given area may also have an effect on where someone may choose to locate a new business. Therefore, by identifying high-crime areas we hope to be able to reccomend safer areas for prospective business owners to locate their new franchises.

Furthermore, by using the entirety of the city of Los Angeles our hope is to identify a number of different potential locations within the bounds of the city for business owners to choose from. This will ensure that we cater to businesses of all types in all areas of the city.

Lastly, we want to know if there are steps being taken to improve the cleanliness of certain sectors within the city. We will examine proposed solutions and initiatives by the representatives from several Council Districts within Los Angeles. For those who have clean districts, what is the reason? For those who don't, are they taking steps in the right direction?

So, the expected audience is business owners looking to create new or expand existing businesses, and business owners would benefit from our business use case in the aforementioned way.
